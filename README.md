# Procurator

My GoLang project manager/helper TUI 

![](./.media/vhs.gif)


## Description

It's TUI which automatically run `go mod tidy; go vet` if any file in directory changes and shows result.
Apart from that, here is regular quick commands like `git add .`, `git push`, `go fmt`...

 
### Installation

`go install git.sual.in/casual/procurator@latest`

### Usage

`procurator` in git repo directory 

## TODO

 - add other quick commands 
 - add VHS gif in readme
 - check all TODO in code (like `go vet` only on `.go` files change) and write here
 - clean code
 - add programming language autodetect
 - add other programming language support
 - add support of detecting changes in subfolders (maybe it works)
 - make quick commands configurable/modular (like in project file with commands) (or presets/user-defined)
